Nutanix Buckets is our new storage solution for handling data as objects. Objects are considered unstructured data and can be of any type including photos, logs, and videos. Here “unstructured” means the data is organized in a flat hierarchy with no file systems or traditional blocks. Objects are composed by data, metadata (about the object), and a unique key used to identify the object. Objects are stored inside of “buckets”, which could contain billions of objects. The name ‘bucket’ is not unique to Nutanix, other object storage solutions may use the same nomenclature to refer to the ‘container’ where objects are placed inside of. This storage solution is ideal for storing and handling large amounts of data as it can scale to Petabytes in size and provides greater accessibility to the data. Accessing objects can be achieved via HTTP REST API calls (such as PUT, GET, DELETE, etc. …). Nutanix Buckets is compatible with Amazon Simple Storage Service API (S3 API).@@pic/buckets-1.png(6.3)@@Use cases for Nutanix Buckets: 1. Integration with Backup SW2.
