The main challenge with the traditional infrastructure is that it was designed where the data is stored away from the CPU and memory (Compute). So, imagine with every read/write operation the CPU cores are wasting time and processing cycles waiting for the journey to the storage is completed.
• In addition to the infrastructure complexity underneath the applications and all the skills required to keep the LEDs on.
• Let’s now look at how Nutanix solved this infrastructure challenge. Nutanix pioneered the concept of hyperconverged infrastructure. Hyperconvergence natively converges compute and storage into x86 servers with attached flash and hard disk drives that are deployed as a single cluster.
• Customers can start with a small footprint — three nodes in a 2U rack space and can add compute and storage capacity when needed. Hyperconvergence radically simplifies how infrastructure is deployed and managed, and reduces the footprint of IT infrastructure by up to 90%
• Nutanix has not stopped there. Nutanix solution natively integrates enterprise-class virtualization right into the product. The hypervisor comes pre-installed on all Nutanix appliances, and cluster and VM management is built into the integrated management platform that is also part of the standard product. No additional components to install or manage. Powerful virtualization features such as VM high availability, live migration and one-click hypervisor upgrades come standard and can be fully managed using the same management interface. Admins can configure their Nutanix clusters in minutes and start deploying applications right away.

• As shown in the above figure Nutanix solution is not only HCI, but an entire datacenter stack from Network security and segmentation up to the automation and orchestration.
• Nutanix has main objective in building the modernized datacenters to keep the customer choice applicable on every building block as shown in the below figure.
• As shown in the below figure, there are much more sub-components in Nutanix Enterprise cloud platform that to be considered as another option for HCI solution.

Mission Critical and enterprise applications are well seated on Nutanix infrastructure, making perfect use of the below features (not limited to):

• Nutanix Data locality: where data (storage) has never been closer to the Compute resources as on Nutanix. This eliminates all inter communication network latency and allow for less number of cores and the highest resource efficiency.
• All Flash Nodes: To accommodate the sub-millisecond latency apps. Nutanix is providing the all flash nodes to eliminate any disk or storage subsystem latency during the extensive random data access that is against storage tiering.
• Optimized CPU Cores and Memory: Nutanix proposed solution is based on balanced sizing for CPU cores and memory to eliminate any performance bottlenecks with minimum network contingency. Such design is proposed to reduce the overall cluster contingency as the cluster grows over time.
• Purpose build Nodes: Nutanix proposed solution is crafted over different hardware series that are build from the ground up to fit the running apps requirements and business needs. Some nodes are proposed in Nutanix cluster to optimize the cost of applications licensing, other nodes are beefy nodes with very high capacity to align with the massive storage aggressive applications. Bottom line, that in Nutanix proposed solution, we design the entire solution to serve the applications better and optimize the TCO/ROI for the apps when shifted to work on Nutanix.
• Balanced Memory Configuration: The proposed solution is built over the highest memory bandwidth configuration (2666MHz) per memory controller, eliminating any other memory configuration that increase the memory capacity per node over the memory bandwidth resulting in more CPU overhead and unbalanced performance.
• Nutanix Shadow Clones: Nutanix Shadow Clones allow for distributed caching of a particular disk or VM data, which are in a ‘multi-reader’ scenario. This will work in any scenario, which may be a multi-reader scenario (e.g. deployment servers, repositories, etc.).
• Data or I/O locality is critical for the highest possible VM performance and a key structure of the Nutanix File System (NDFS). With Shadow Clones the NDFS will monitor disk access trends. When all of the requests are read I/O, the disk, in our case the replica, will be marked as immutable. Once the disk has been marked as immutable the disk will then be cached locally by each Nutanix node making read requests to it. In the background, when that happens every CVM gets the map of where the immutable disk blocks are. If the disk data is local to the node great, if not it will automatically retrieve the data, without relying on the original CVM maintaining the replica disk, thus eliminating any possible service degradation due to multiple access request to the original CVM to copy the data.
• Nutanix Volumes: where storage will be provided from Nutanix cluster to external physical servers providing unique scalability, resiliency and simplicity features. ABS is ideal for existing server investment protection, maximize the server performance and storage load distribution and for applications that can’t be virtualized due to legacy dependencies or licenses constrains.
• Nutanix Files:  Even NAS functionality is now hosted and entertained on the scale-out Nutanix architecture, eliminating the silos of NAS. AFS is Workload aware, so you can scale capacity by adding platform nodes, or performance by adding File Server VMs to your cluster. In other words, you can Scale up or scale out on demand. AFS is built to handle Billions of files and 10s of thousands of user sessions. Lastly, Enterprise Storage Features are inherited from the underlying Distributed Storage Fabric. Intelligent tiering, Dedup, compression and EC are some of these very useful features. Back up and DR based on block-level snapshots / consistency groups in DSF. Self Service based.
• Deduplication and Compression: Those data services are available everywhere now, but what you need to understand how to enable and most important the consequences of disabling those features. In Nutanix cluster, deduplication and compression are enabled independently based on the application requirements. Those data services are enabled per vdisk per virtual machine. Disabling any deduplication or compression is a background activity that doesn’t require any data evacuation, re-formatting or even data migration.
• Replication: is native without any additional or hidden cost. Nutanix offers 3 embedded replication methods async, sync (Metro-Availability) and near-sync replication. Replication is managed from Prism interface, no need for additional or external 3rd party licenses.
• Integrated Snapshots and Clones: natively integrated through the Prism interface. Provides protection for the VMs between the normal backup windows for faster RPO and RTO.
