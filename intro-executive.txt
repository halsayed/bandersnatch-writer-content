Nutanix radically simplifies your enterprise datacenter by integrating server and storage resources into a turnkey appliance that is deployed in just 30 to 60 minutes, and runs any application at any scale. You can start with a few servers and scale to thousands, with predictable performance and economics. Nutanix was founded in 2009 and is built with the same distributed software architecture powering leading Web-scale and cloud infrastructures, such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, named “Web-Scale IT”. Web-Scale IT consists of a few principles that are key for a modern datacenter:

1) 100 % software-defined with no reliance on special purpose hardware for resilience, performance and availability. Allowing for new capabilities without hardware upgrades;
2) All data, metadata and operations are distributed across the entire cluster, eliminating performance bottlenecks and enabling predictable scalability without limits;
3) Designed to tolerate component failures through fault isolation and automatic recovery without bringing down the overall system;
4) Extensive automation and rich system-wide monitoring for data-driven efficiency combined with REST-based programmatic interfaces for integration with datacenter management tools.
