Calm is a multi-cloud application management framework delivered by Nutanix.  Calm provides application automation and lifecycle management natively integrated into the Nutanix Platform.  With Calm, applications are defined via simple blueprints that can be easily created using industry standard skills and control all aspects of the application’s lifecycle, such as provisioning, scaling, and cleanup. Once created, a blueprint can be easily published to end users through the Nutanix Marketplace, instantly transforming a complex provisioning ticket into a simple one-click request.
